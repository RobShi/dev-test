# ShiMart

This is the ShiMart kata in TypeScript. If you have an IDE you're comfortable with, you can run all othese operations from within the IDE. If you prefer command line, guidance is provided below.

## Getting started

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Run the application

To run the application with the default number of days (31):

```sh
npm start
```

To run with a specific number of days:

```sh
npm start 10
```

## Run the unit tests from the Command-Line

There are three unit test frameworks to choose from: Jest, Mocha, and Vitest.

```sh
npm run test:jest
```

To run all tests in watch mode

```sh
npm run test:jest:watch
```

Mocha

```sh
npm run test:mocha
```

Vitest

```sh
npm run test:vitest
```
